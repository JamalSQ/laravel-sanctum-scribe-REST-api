## API Documentation

- API endpoints are documented using **Scribe** annotations in controller PHPDoc blocks.
- Documentation includes:
  - Endpoint descriptions and grouping.
  - Request parameters (`@bodyParam`, `@urlParam`).
  - Example responses with proper HTTP status codes.
  - Authentication requirements.
- The generated docs are in Blade/HTML format and require the Laravel app to be running to view.

### Exporting Documentation as PDF

- Scribe does not provide built-in PDF export.
- You can:
  - Use your browser's "Print to PDF" feature (may have formatting limitations).
  - Export OpenAPI spec generated by Scribe and convert it to PDF using third-party tools like `swagger2pdf` or `RapiPDF`.

## API Endpoints Overview

### CompanyController

- `GET /companies` - List all companies.
- `POST /companies` - Create a new company.
- `GET /companies/{company}` - Retrieve a specific company.
- `PUT /companies/{company}` - Update a company.
- `DELETE /companies/{company}` - Delete a company.

### AuthController

- `POST /login` - User login, returns API token.
- `POST /register` - User registration.

---

## Best Practices Followed

- Proper use of HTTP status codes:
  - `200 OK` for successful retrieval and updates.
  - `201 Created` for successful resource creation.
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity` for validation errors.
  - `401 Unauthorized` for authentication failures.
  - `404 Not Found` for missing resources.
- Secure password handling with hashing.
- Clear and consistent JSON responses.
- Use of Laravel Form Requests for validation.
- Detailed and valid JSON examples in documentation.
